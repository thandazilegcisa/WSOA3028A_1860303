            Hi, my name is Xolani i like to refer to myself as a Zeitgeist,
            which means "Spirit of the age". I am a cultural historian who lives
            in Johannesburg.Though i grew up in Gqeberha, in the Eastern Cape My
            particular areas of interest are art, games, and music. I am
            dedicated both to research and practice of cultural history or using
            cultural artefact and history into creating and understanding the
            world we live in.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ultimate goal of my research is to see and understand
            Johannesburg from the lens of its history and culture. More
            specifically music. The aim is to illustrate how Sophiatown as a
            space, cultivated cultural artefacts. And what meanings did
            residents reflect in these artefact. I also consider how the
            meanings inscribed in the art created in Sophiatown reflect the time
            and space within which the artists operated and how their operation
            was organised.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, the reason why i chose and created this character is
            because i wanted to use the internet as messanger that archives
            organises history. Hence, this web pages aims to democratise
            information and become an extension of the interent in which, the
            topics that i or others would wish to talk about are represented in
            what i am offering. Despite the fact that this knowledge has been
            accounted for and the fact that i can execute the project is
            testament to that, i wanted to focus on the story of the subject in
            question from the basis of the cultural artefacts that it has
            created in as a result of histroy. So
