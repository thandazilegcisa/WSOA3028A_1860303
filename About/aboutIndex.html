            Hi, my name is Xolani i like to refer to myself as a Zeitgeist,
            which means "Spirit of the age". I am a 20 year old skateboarder who
            lives in Johannesburg. I am mostly a street skateboarder, although i
            first started out as a cruising skateboarder, skating just for the
            sake of travelling to and from school. I then started learning
            tricks as i continued to travel around Johannesburg going to
            different parks, making new friends and ultimately learnt street and
            park skateboarding tricks. The first trick i ever learnt, though
            admittedly after several bails, "credit cards", and knee scrapes was
            a kick flip. It was a very proud moment, that i will never forget
            and whenever i am not fliping tricks, i am cruising taking
            photographs of beautiful metropolitan Johannesburg. This Character
            is loosely based off of a friend of mine that i have not seen in a
            very long while. So i guess this website is an attempt to render him
            visible and somewhat accessibile because "The medium is the
            message".
