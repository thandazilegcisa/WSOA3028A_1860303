                <h3 class="">A reflection on Tim Berners Lee's: The World Wide Web.</h3>
                <p>
                  <blockquote>"The world wide web first began life at CERN, a European
                  laboratory for Particle Physics in Geneva, Switzerland".</blockquote>
                  <cite>(Berners-Lee, 1994)</cite>
                  <p>Berners- Lee, the inventor of the web, came up with a solution
                    to aid the dissemination of research and information
                    amongst his peers and the critical mass. As such he came up
                    with a <strong>distributed</strong> network that allows researchers from
                    different parts of the world to organize and efficiently
                    gather information from multiple sources.</p> 
                </p>
                <p>
                  The web was designed, with the idea of creating a distributed
                  hypertext system that affords users with the ability to work
                  independently. This design is reflected and illustrated by
                  version control systems, namely git and git hub, which
                  provides a platform or server within which a team member can
                  independently work on a team project from remote locations around the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Typically a client <em></em>(browser) is used to request
                  information off a server <em>(a computer that runs the
                  back-end of the internet)</em> which, is used to store the metadata 
                  of any data that is represented on the internet. The server then responds to the 
                  clients request by retrieving an html document, which it 
                  interprets and describes to the client in order to render 
                  multimedia information.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Moreover the web uses an address system, network protocol
                  html to process and respond to a clients request. The first way tThis
                  address system is called a URL - Universal Resource
                  Identifiers, and is used to retrieve and embed the ip address
                  of a desired repository or site as a domain name, so that a
                  user can find and address any object as the set of protocol
                  parameters necessary to access the document.

                <h3>What is Semantic Markup? Why is it necessary</h3>
                <p>
                  The word "Semantics" is a branch of semiotics which interprets
                  the representational value of signs and symbols through the study 
                  of meanings.Hence in programming, Semantics refers to the syntactical 
                  meaning of a piece of code within a given document.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To give a document meaning is to render it usable and responsive to
                  the contextual needs of any user receiving information from a browser.
                  If the browsers contextual needs are met, the browser will be able to 
                  render all the documents needed to structure, and embed multimedia faster,
                  to optimize the performance of the web so that every user is able to 
                  "experience" the web.Another reason would be for the optimization of web 
                  searches, and monitoring of web services and sites.
                </p>
                <h3>What is a browser and how does it work</h3>
                <p>
                  A browser is a client - side programme that hosts users requests and responds
                  with various multimedia elements (texts, images, audio, and videos). 
                  This occurs whenever a user requests a document by entering a URL, clicking a link 
                  or submitting a form. As such the Semantic mark up of the page becomes paramount
                  to the prospects of minimizing the delay between client - server interaction.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The browser starts by first identifying the markup of a given page and attempts to
                  find where the embedded multimedia elements are located. For secure transactions to
                  happen within this process a TLS negotiation needs to take place wherein this negotiation
                  determines how to encrypt communication, verifies the server and establishes a secure
                  connection between the client and the server so that the user does not become exposed
                  to any malicious intent. After a connection is established parsing takes place, this 
                  is a step the browser takes to turn the data it receives over the network and into the Dom, 
                  which is then used to render a web pages layout, paint, style and compositing described 
                  within an html and the DOM tree - a DOM tree describes the content of a document, and
                  reflects the different sematic, stylistic relationships and hierarchies a document has 
                  to offer.
