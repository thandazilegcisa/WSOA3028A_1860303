      <p>
        The reason why i chose the pallet included in the style guide is
        because, i wanted a very minimalistic look. Mosty due to the fact that
        Xolani is a very modest and humble person. So, i thought the colors
        included are indicative of his personality type.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the styling of the text. I wanted something that is very readable
        so, sticking to font that is from the san-serif familiy was very
        important to me. So that the user can read the text without any hassle.
      </p>
      <p>
        And lastly for the styling of navigation, the aim was also to be
        minimalistic, so that the functions of the site are easily found or
        readable. The Navigation links have two states, one indicative of a user
        hovering on the navigation ui and the second, when the user is not
        hovering on the button, which is left as plain text. The reason for
        changing colour when hovering is because i wanted there to be some level
        of feedback to indicate whether a button is pressed hopefully such
        interactions will also be implemented across the site through the
        development of the website.
