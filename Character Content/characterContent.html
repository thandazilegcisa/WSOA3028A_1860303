          Sophiatown is a suburb in Johannesburg that was originally a whites
          only area under apartheid rule. When a sewage dump was built next to
          the area, wealth meant gave people the option not to live there
          anymore. Though, as the real estate value dropped. Sophiatown became
          an inexpensive place that allowed more black people moved to the city,
          which meant that Sophiatown became a home to a significant amount of
          black people who came into the city looking for work.This meant that
          it was one of the few places in in urban areas where black people were
          allowed to own land.

          In the 80s and early 90s Jazz was used to fight oppression. <br />
          Thus, residents of Sophiatown often cultivated a rich culture based on
          using shebeens as public spaces where people could gather for
          entertainment.
        </p>

        <p>
          This as a result played a significant role in shaping and developing
          Jazz in South Africa. Created from a need to survive together.
          Therefore, Sophiatown residents were determined to lead respectable
          lives in the shadow of a state that was hostile toward the residents.

          The musical King Kong, a musical festival. Is described by historians
          as the reason behind the blossoming of Sophiatown's multi-racial
          cultural exploits in the 1950s. The musical depicted street life,
          violence, disparity of life and jazz. When King Kong premiered in
          Johannesburg a 70 strong cast that featured Hugh Masekela, Miriam
          Makeba, Gwigwi Mrwebi and Phyllis Mnqoma became an overnight hit.

          However as life continued. On 9 February 1955, the apartheid
          government rolled out the demolition of Sophiatown and forceably
          removed 60000 of its inhabitants

        <p>Thats is not the end of it though. <br>
          Because although the physical materiality of Sophiatown was demolished
          i.e buildings houses. The cultural artefacts including literature and 
          theatre plays signified the time in which they were living in which is
          an artists solem duty.
        </p>
        <p>
          The influences of Sophiatown live on in jazz till to day. And that is the 
          beauty behind the madness.
