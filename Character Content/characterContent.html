          This is an image of the first skateboard that i have ever owned. It is
          a long time since then. I think i was about 14 years old. I remember i
          had to save up like one quarter of the market price at the time. This
          was a solem deal that i had brokered with my mother because she told
          me that she wanted to teach me how to save my own money. It worked. I
          am now on my third skateboard and the last one i bought i purchased it
          myself. This has given we freedom in every sense of the work because
          everyday i get to ride and connect with places that i probably would
          have not thought to visit if it weren't for my skateboard. Kind of
          like how the internet connects people. I should probably check if i
          have pictures of how each of my former boards ended up that will
          probably be up in the content section in the near future.

          This is an image of the the first pair of shoes that went bust after
          countless of hours, of countless attempts of tricks. As you may know
          because they are very popular, these shoes are called Vans. Vans is a
          skateboard brand that was established in 1966. This design was
          actually one of the first designs by the company, they were initially
          released in 1977 and rebooted in the 2010s where they came back a
          cultural phenomenon, not only for skateboarders since in 20th century
          they were designed for skateboarders, but they instead came back with
          a fresh look that invited every culture or sub-culture to slide on a
          pair for any casual occasion. I have them here because shoes or
          skateboard sneakers are an important part of skateboarding culture and
          the identity of a skateboarder. They are indicative of all time spent
          kicking against a piece of wood to set a score with the laws of
          Physics and as you can see it really takes the "soul" out of you.
