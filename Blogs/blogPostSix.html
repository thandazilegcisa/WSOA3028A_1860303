                Alternative Approaches to Interface Technologies

                In the paper of the above tile, authour Steve Gibson examines
                and explores interfaces that diverge form the standard
                mouse-keyboard approaches to interacting with digital systems.
                He suggests that alternative interfaces can generally be
                described as control schemes that allow the user to connect to a
                digital environment <strong>without</strong> the use of
                conventional mouse-keyboard interfaces.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the paper, Gibson brings up a few interesting examples to
                explore alternative approaches. Although there is one particular
                example that fascinated me the most, which concerns using MIDI
                instruments as a control scheme. The conventional use of Midi as
                an interface and language stems from the need for computers and
                midi instruments to transmit and convey musical information.
                Essentially midi is a tool for transmitting signal between to
                subjects and therefore the usefulness of midi is that is not a
                piano, as it does not transmit audio information between itself
                and the computer. It only mediates communication between an
                instrument e.g.) a synthesiser and a computer.
              </p>
              <p>
                Therefore, the question that arises as Gibson writes is whether
                midi can be used as an alternative control scheme for
                non-musical uses. That being said i'd say yes, in fact midi is
                being used by various individuals as a control scheme for
                playing games. Considering the fact that this article was
                written in 2004. Gibson does not make any mention in his
                examination of games and how they can be controlled by midi
                instruments.Below is an example of such:
              </p>
              <iframe
                width="560"
                height="315"
                src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3gA6coU1eZE"
                title="YouTube video player"
                frameborder="0"
                allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
                allowfullscreen
              >
              </iframe>
              <br />
              <p>
                Despite not mentioning games he instead makes reference to
                visual music. And what he means by this term follows an
                investigation into the use of midi as an input device for
                contolling visual environments. As such considering that games
                are hypermedia a corelation can be made between what he writes
                about visual music and games. Because his goal was to
                investigate if "midi can seamlessly control a visual environment
                to the point where a user would be able to "play" the images in
                real time as if he or she were "playing" musical notes.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a result from this example we can deduce that for a midi
                control scheme to be successful as in the case of games. Users
                must clearly understand what is happening in the process
                (immediate feedback) and they must also understand the
                connection between the 'musical performance' amd the
                corresponding visual or mechanical result of the game or any
                other interactive system.
