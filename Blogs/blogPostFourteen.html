                    Web Robots are defined as web spiders that search the internet for different types of information.
                    Thus, they can be used for cyber security purposes or malicious automated attempts to protect,
                    locate information easier and by extension attack websites for information by finding vulnerabilities.
                    Web bots usually perform repetitive tasks, with a higher efficiency rate and scale that would normally 
                    be slowand tedious for humans to perform manually. Therefore, they are often referred to as the worker 
                    bees of the internet.

                    Ultimately there are advantages and disadvantages to bots: they inspect the accessibility or usability 
                    to help make the internet inclusive and yet they are the cause of malicious intent because different 
                    malicious web bots are used by hackers to exploit a system or in some instances they may be used to 
                    cause traffic, which could result in latencies in client response and therefore prevent people form 
                    visiting a specific Website.
