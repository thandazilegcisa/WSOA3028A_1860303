                In the paper of the above title, authours Hassenzahl et al.
                (2005) examine what is meant by user experience. I also attempts
                to demonstrate the relation or lack thereof of the designer's
                intentions and a user's actual experience. Since the beginning
                of the proliferation or web apps, games and the internet
                interaction on these applications or mediums have called for
                considering how a user will experience using the medium. Thus,
                early research on the phenomenological experience of products
                have largely focused on the outcome of goals in work settings.
                This includes leader-boards, badges, point-systems and UI to
                ensure that a product is designed for an optimal experience.

              <p>
                Hence, early research largely focused on reward based
                gratification methods for constructing "enjoyable" user
                experiences. Despite the fact that this might be good for
                short-term results focus hardly ever shifted to creating
                intrinsic motivation or value rather than extrinsic motivation.
                Intrinsic motivation becomes very important when considering the
                implications of user experiences because it means that users are
                motivated to experience the product not because of a reward but
                for personal, transformational reasons in order to satisfy
                general human needs. As such Hassenzahl et al. (2005) argues
                that "future human computer interactions must be concerned about
                the pragmatic needs of interactive products such as
                identification and evocation". Which is important because
                intrinsic motivation becomes and instrument in providing agency
                for the user to use and experience the product continuously.
              </p>

                In the paper authours highlight two ways in which User
                Experience can be achieved namely through emotional and
                affective design, and experientially. Although for the sake of
                this article I'll focus on experientially mainly because a
                designer designs for emotion and not emotion itself so it would
                be difficult to quantify if the emotions in questions is or can
                be achieved. The experiential perspective on UX emphasises two
                aspects of technological use namely, situatedness and
                temporality.From this perspective "an experience is a unique
                combination of various elements, such as the product and the
                internal states of the user which extend over time with a
                definitive beginning and end." I completely agree with this
                statement because how designer should approach designing
                products is to design to meet a users needs, coupled by
                considering how accessible and usable the product is and if it
                is able to provide the user with positive feedback. For example
                in this site as of assignment three when a user hovers over a
                clickable link the link changes colour and background colour
                This way the user is able to know if their actions are inputted
                by the system or not which provides for user experiences. And
                the extent to which this sites character is fleshed out
                (including the current theory) is also meant to provide
                intrinsic value to the site and give the site meaning as to why
                it should exist and why users should care.
