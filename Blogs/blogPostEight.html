              <p>
                Monitoring the semiotic design of hypermedia is important mainly
                because understanding how designers construct meaning through
                hypermedia is valuable for the designer themselves so that there
                is semantic coherence across the platform and the contents that
                it provides. Semiotics as a theory is a very old but gold theory
                that defines semiotics as signs, signifier that represent or
                communicate an idea. The very text that you are reading is a
                referral to semiotics.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although semiotics has been largely used to analyse film and
                static artefacts. Currently, the model has and can be used fo
                design tasks such as developing hypermedia. It attempts to guide
                the artist or designer in optimising the process if inscribing
                meaning into the desired system. In their article Toppano and
                Roberto propose three ways of either analysing (decoding) or
                inscribing (encoding) semiotic devices to create meaning in
                hypermedia. They include a narrative approach, a
                semi-structuralist model, and communication perspectives.
              </p>
              <p>
                The narrative approach implies that every semiotic device be it
                drawings, photographs, games or music all have a narrative. And
                a semi-structuralist model which outlines a continuum of levels
                that meaning passes through to be construct, the most important
                (at least to me) being level three, which he defines as a
                discursive level. This is a level in which "abstract narrative
                components such as props, set dressing are translated and infer
                to concrete and thematic elements". Lastly, the communication
                perspective attempts to assist in analysing hypermedia within a
                social an cultural context.
                <br />
                This way, the dialogue between the designer or artist and user
                is mediated by semiotic devices and is inscribed within the text
                therefore, this substantiate the point that my first blog post
                makes which is that the medium is the message.
