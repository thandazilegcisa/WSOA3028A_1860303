                    <p>
                      In the book: The medium is the message Marshal McLuhan writes that
                      <blockquote>"The medium is the message because it is the medium that shapes and controls
                        the scale and form of human association and action and thus the medium in which information
                        is communicated through is more important than the message itself"
                      </blockquote>
                      <cite>(McLuhan, 1964)</cite>
                    </p>
                    <p>To understand what this means we have to understand what medium and message mean.
                      Medium, refers to the tools or instruments used to provide agency to a user. Message refers
                      to the contextual underpinnings that tools use to cultivate meaning through the use of 
                      semiotics such as text, images, and audio all of which are hypermedia which provide an 
                      extension outside the traditional analogue media constraints.
                    </p>
                    <p>With this knowledge we are able to understand the world wide web as a mechanic that functions 
                      as an interconnected continuum of inter-textual meanings created by the ability for the medium 
                      to have an adverse effect on the scale and form of human action. Therefore,through the structure
                      and configuration of hypermedia, and hyperlinking. It becomes clear that the non-linear 
                      reception and reciprocation of threads of information between a network of people sharing and 
                      retrieving information on a distributed network is the message.
