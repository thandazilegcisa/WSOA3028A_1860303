                    A browser is a client - side programme that hosts users requests and responds
                    with various multimedia elements (texts, images, audio, and videos). 
                    This occurs whenever a user requests a document by entering a URL, clicking a link 
                    or submitting a form. As such the Semantic mark up of the page becomes paramount
                    to the prospects of minimizing the delay between client - server interaction.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The browser begins by identifying the markup of a given webpage and attempts to
                    find where the embedded multimedia elements are located. For secure transactions to
                    take place within this process a TLS negotiation needs to take place to 
                    negotiate and determine how to encrypt communication between users, and verifies
                    the server to establish a secure connection between the client and the server to
                    prevent the user from becoming exposed to any malicious intent. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After a connection is established parsing takes place, this is a step the browser takes to turn the 
                    data it receives over the network and into the Dom, which is then used to render
                    a web pages layout, paint, style and compositing described within an html and 
                    the DOM tree - a DOM tree describes the content of a document, and reflects the 
                    different semantic, stylistic relationships, and hypermedia a web page has to offer.

                    During the development of this website developer tools was extremely important to me. Because 
                    through the browser i was able to audition styles for my website and check how they fit within
                    the overall layout. I also used the developer tools's console to debug code, to check if certain
                    functions are working and their output. Therefore, i am now able to actively work in the browser 
                    without actually changing or writing code in my IDE. T
