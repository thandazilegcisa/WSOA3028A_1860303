                Towards a study of information geographies: (im)mutable

                Information is innately entrenched within the context within
                which it is formed and argued upon. Therefore, the study of
                information geographies examine how context shapes or is
                mediated by the infrastructure, technologies and networks within
                a specific context. Ever since the proliferation of
                post-mechanical re-production ability of computers the
                transmission and movement of information has become much more
                accessibile, and by accessibile I mean non-exclusive. However,
                there are are certain barriers to entry that have their own
                geographic effects on the overall reception of information
                across the world, this includes considerations regarding how,
                easily certain geographies have access to participate and
                represent themselves on the internet using computing devices
                such as mobile phones and computers.

                Hence, this website aims to, represent the global south in that
                regard because our character is a cultural historian that seeks
                to document his love for jazz music and how the space within
                which the jazz was made influenced its output. Therefore, by so
                doing the character represents those who were previously not
                represented and searches for the beaut of that representation to
                highligh and use this website as a platform to share
                (participate) and represent the story of where he comes from.
                The technical component of the site is also indicative of this
                sentiment because this site is hosted on github pages and
                therefore as a result counts as another commit, push of
                information every time i execute those git functions.

                Before, the impetus of the internet the knowledge economy of
                information was unchanging over a period of time. Due to the
                traditional printing of information on paper, which meant that
                information was simultaneously fixed to a physical object and
                its local context. However, today information is not fixed to a
                physical object, because the internet as a platform, this site
                mediates and links research from all around the world, although
                the problem with this new affordance is that accessing the
                technology itself has now become the priviledge the power that
                gives people not only the power to participate but also encode
                how they want to be represented on the internet, hence they
                shape information rather than just reflecting and decoding
                information.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is where the concept of power and its relation to
                information geographies becomes important to understand because
                power hinges on the ability for every citizen to be an agent
                that has agency over the internet as a platform to attain,
                distribute, and create information. Otherwise if the
                democratisation of information is not possible a ruling or
                dominant "threshold guardian or gatekeeper" would control how
                certain geographies are represented without consent from the
                actual context the information is from. Therefore, to
                investigate how, where and by whom is information created by we
                need to investigate how different geographies access,
                participate and represent themselves on the internet.

                South Africa (which is where my character and i resides) much
                like in the rest of africa, internet penetration is relatively
                low compared to the rest of the world (Global North). Coupled
                with high broadband costs in some areas in the continent,
                historical socio-economic disadvantages also play a major role
                in who has the power to access the internet because the higher
                the economic cost of access on the internet does not bode well
                with the issue of low distributions of wealth and income in the
                global south. For example in a country like South Africa where a
                group of market competitors (MTN, Vodacom, Cell C, Telkom)
                control the market the price of data could take up to a two
                thirds of the salary of an average worker, which makes access
                unequal because not all branches of society have the power to
                participate.

                With this in mind the according to Graham et al (2015) to
                understand participation he explores three avenues, namely,
                domain names, github users and wikipedia edits and for the sake
                of this article i'll focus on github users. Mostly because this
                sites domain name and code base is hosted on github. Despite
                being the largest hosting service in the world and providing a
                platform for a decentralised distribution of information the
                relation between internet users and github users is substantial,
                at least in the global south. The Middle East, North Africa and
                Sub-Saharan africa stand out with the lowest levels of
                participation or "contribution" to the worlds largest code base,
                combined according to Graham et al (2015) the regions are home
                to less than 1% of github users and commits. Therefore in sum
                this indicates where the power of participation, and
                representation lies. However this site in indicative of the fact
                that the global south has the ability, power and agency to
                represent themselves if given access as i have been given this
                laptop that i am typing by providing access through institutions
                of learning,and libraries etc.
