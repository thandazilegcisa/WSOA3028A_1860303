                A reflection on the works of Borges- The Library of Babel and
                Garden of Forking Paths
              </h2>
              <p>
                In the book, The Library of Babel, Borges writes about a public
                space, known as the library. This universe of books is typified
                by identical hexagonal shaped rooms that are inhabited by books
                that are filled with all of the information that the universe
                has created as well as information that is yet to be put into
                the world. The library of babel has no limits, which is
                indicative of the way the internet structures information. The
                proliferation of the internet over past three decades has
                allowed many people across a broad range of demographics and
                geographies to partake in the knowledge formation and economy of
                what is shared on the internet.
              </p>
              <p>
                The library of babel is exemplary of our ability to search for
                something on the internet. A user has no limits as to what they
                can search for because the internet has information that the
                universe has created, reference or adapted from traditional
                media, and information yet to be put into the word but put into
                the world at the point of searching or providing any input to
                the system. The library of babel signifies a public space that
                is unconstrained, therefore information might be very hard to
                get, thus it is interesting to consider Borges book, the Garden
                of Forking Paths to illustrate how scale can be mitigated by
                affectively managing 'time'. It writes that time is an important
                factor to consider because time is a metaphor for diverging
                paths. Paths that exist simultaneously continuously intertwining
                and diverging all in one structure - the garden. So, this is
                indicative of how the browser as a structure can help us save
                time by creating tabs that can be concieved in the light that
                Borges suggests. Therefore this introduces the idea of hypertext
                and hyperlinking of information, which makes it easier to scale
                on information and save time while at it.
