                A reflection on the works of Borges- The Library of Babel and
                Garden of Forking Paths
              </h2>
              <p>
                In the book, The Library of Babel, Borges writes about a public
                space, known as the library. This universe of books is typified
                by identical hexagonal shaped rooms that are inhabited by books
                that are filled with all of the information that the universe
                has created as well as information that is yet to be put into
                the world. The library of babel has no limits, which is
                indicative of the way the internet structures information. The
                proliferation of the internet over past three decades has
                allowed many people across a broad range of demographics and
                geographies to partake in the knowledge formation and economy of
                what is shared on the internet.
              </p>
              <p>
                The library of babel is exemplary of our ability to search for
                something on the internet. A user has no limits as to what they
                can search for because the internet has information that the
                universe has created, reference or adapted from traditional
                media, and information yet to be put into the word but put into
                the world at the point of searching or providing any input to
                the system. The library of babel signifies a public space that
                is unconstrained, therefore information might be very hard to
                get, thus it is interesting to consider Borges book, the Garden
                of Forking Paths to illustrate how scale can be mitigated by
                affectively managing 'time'.
              </p>
              <p>
                It writes that time is an important factor to consider because
                time is a metaphor for diverging paths. Paths that exist
                simultaneously continuously intertwining and diverging all in
                one structure - the garden. So, this is indicative of how the
                browser as a structure can help us save time by creating tabs
                that can be made in the light that Borges suggests. Therefore
                this introduces the idea of hypertext and hyperlinking of
                information, which makes it easier to scale on information and
                save time while at it.
              </p>
              <h2>What does all of this have to do with my site?</h2>
              <p>
                The library of babel is reflected in this site through the way
                in which some of the images used for this site are linked from
                another website. The internet as a platform in this case is the
                library of babel and through the use of hyperlinks i am able to
                traverse the internet in an effort to gather information.
