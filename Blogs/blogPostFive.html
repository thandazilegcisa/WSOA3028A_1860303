                      The most colloquial form of interaction humans partake in communication, and typically we interact
                      through responsive participation through communication. Responsive communication is the enacted output
                      of conversation, which means it is an active response to a question, comment or elaboration. Whereas
                      participation is idle and non-trivial or responsive. As such defining 'interactivity' requires 
                      determining how and why a response makes something interactive? Interaction takes the form of taking
                      control and occurs in the process of user's trying to understand the readability of something to 
                      orient themselves and develop skill in using a product - the internet.

                    <p>
                      Therefore, <blockquote>"Something is interactive if 
                      it is <strong>responsive</strong>, <strong>does not completely control</strong>, is <strong>
                      not completely controlled</strong>, and does not <strong>respond in a random fashion
                      </strong>"
                      </blockquote>

                      <h4>Which begs to question, How does interaction work on the world wide web?</h4>
                      <p>Well, interaction on the web is commonly weakly interactive as compared to something like a game.
                        Although, one can always develop a game or strongly interactive art on the web that could also 
                        make the web strongly interactive, meaning that users would not only be able to affect the 
                        way in which the reception of information is sequenced, but as well as affecting the process 
                        of how something is structured and/or made.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Therefore, interaction on the web occurs through the use of the following: <br>
                        <ol>
                          <li>User Interface</li>
                          <li>Mouse Events</li>
                          <li>Keyboard Events</li>
                        </ol>
                        <dl>
                          <dt><h5><em>User Interface:</em></h5></dt>
                          <dd>
                            These events are non-diegetic events that does not affect the structure of 
                            a webpage, instead it affects how the browser presents information by resizing 
                            the browser if needed or scrolling to explore the entirety of the web page.
                          </dd>
                          <dt><h5><em>Mouse Events:</em></h3></dt>
                          <dd>
                            These are events that we all use on a daily basis to an extent that we just passively 
                            execute them when we moves or click a mouse button on a webpage.
                          </dd>
                          <dt><h5><em>Keyboard Events:</em></h5></dt>
                          <dd>This is another event that we use on a daily basis, but i would argue that typing on 
                            a keyboard is not as passive as mouse events because i - the user am confronted with 
                            more input choices than a mouse. This gives me the opportunity to be more meaningful 
                            in my decisions, such as when i look for the write letter to complete a word or sentence.
                        </dl>

                    <h3>A reflection on a brief history of Web Robots</h3>
                    <p>
                      Web Robots are defined as web spiders that search the internet for different types of information.
                      Thus, they can be used for cyber security purposes or malicious automated attempts to protect,
                      locate information easier and by extension attack websites for information by finding vulnerabilities.
                      Web bots usually perform repetitive tasks, with a higher efficiency rate and scale that would normally 
                      be slowand tedious for humans to perform manually. Therefore, they are often referred to as the worker 
                      bees of the internet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Ultimately there are advantages and disadvantages to bots: they inspect the accessibility or usability 
                      to help make the internet inclusive and yet they are the cause of malicious intent because different 
                      malicious web bots are used by hackers to exploit a system or in some instances they may be used to 
                      cause traffic, which could result in latencies in client response and therefore prevent people form 
                      visiting a specific Website.
