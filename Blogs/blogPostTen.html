              Digital inequalities of artificial intelligence and big data

              In the article of the above title, authour Christoph Lutz
              investigates the disparities in the structure of access to and use
              of ICT as well as how historical socio-economic inequalities shape
              the expectations and impact of what ICT can provide for life on
              earth. According to Lutz (2015) traditionally disadvantaged
              citizens, which we mostly see in the global south are similarly
              disadvantaged on the internet.Therefore according to Lutz (2015)
              "optimistic claims that the internet would create widespread
              social mobility and would lead to less stratified societies have
              been challenged by digital inequality scholars."
            </p>
            <p>
              In his article Lutz (2015) defines three levels of the digital
              divide between the global south and north. He describes the first
              level as the unequal access to the internet. Which as stated
              before is a direct reflection of unequal access to economic
              participation in globalization. He uses the term Digital divide to
              describe those who do and those who not have access to new forms
              of information technologies. In the paper he highlights the fact
              that in most developed countries the first point of entry for
              users on the internet is computers as compared to mobile in the
              developing or under-developed global south. He references a
              proposition made by other scholars that mobile internet access us
              second-class internet access, and suggests that mobile internet
              offers lower functionality in terms of speed, memory and storage
              capacity.

              Despite not being completely wrong, he is not completely right
              either because if accessibility is the core proponent of his first
              level of digital divide mobile has proven to be considerably more
              accessibile and has aided penetration of users across the global
              south without the need to leave out information or enable
              user-friendly experience. This site is a good example of statement
              because it takes into consideration the ability of the site to
              adapt to different resolutions. To allow the site to reflow the
              content of the page to match different screens, whether rendered
              on a small mobile phone or a large desktop monitor without
              actually loosing any content, so i disagree with the authour on
              that part. Although, i agree that possibly the limitation is that
              it does not allow the user to contribute to the knowledge base of
              the internet as argued in the previous article on this site.
            </p>
            <p>
              Which is the second level that Lutz (2019) implicitly refers to,
              although he does not talk about the concept in the same vain as
              Graham et al. (2015) talks about participation. Instead he refers
              to individuals online recreational activities out site of actually
              creating on the net. So his argument is not well substantiated as
              Graham et al. (2015) despite implicitly referring to the same thin
              "second-digital divide studies have focused on online
              participation and social media, differentiating active content
              creators from passive consumers." Lastly he states that the third
              level divides in such a way that "individuals do not have the
              capacity to translate their internet access and use into
              favourable offline outcomes". Lutz goes on to state that studies
              on third-level digital divide investigate tangible offline
              outcomes from internet use in economic, social, political and
              cultural terms. I have to disagree with Lutz again on this point
              because the very "lowly internet mobile" he describes in the first
              level is largely responsible for such tangible outcomes. For
              example M-Pesa, africa's leading payment method is a platform that
              allows for the transaction of money across africa which is a
              favourable offline outcome because it means that trade, or
              deposits to family has become easier to perform so while mobile
              still provides some limitations in terms of particpation on
              creating technologies it has somewhat closed the gap in service
              industries like banking and transportation etc. Therefore, despite
              being written in 2019 Lutz assumptions and arguments are
              indicative of the fact that he himself is divided from the south
              and his paper is not well researched regarding the intricacies of
              the digital divide as compared to Graham et al. (2015)
