                      I think that this statement is very true an that it also represents the fact that our societies socio-economic structures
                      have also been homogenised by more often than not males, and more specifically white males. As such because of the fact 
                      that this marginalisation is also present in institutions of power (Educational or Enterprises) it illustrates a stark picture 
                      of the digital divide in the use, access and representation of the internet. This is significant because as discussed in
                      previous blog posts because "the medium is the message" and if women cannot use, access and represent themselves on the 
                      internet they cannot transport, share and inscribe their message within the internet. This is especially true for black women
                      because black women are marginalised not only from the object of their body, but their race, and so this dual marginalisation 
                      sets them back two-fold. So Despite the statement being true possibly, the majority of the 10% of women that can use, access 
                      and represent themselves on platforms like wikipedia are white women from the global north. Most women from the global south 
                      are marginalised to the extent of access and not only representation and participation on wikipedia.

                      Which is why the internet needs African feminist's because for example Sheena Magenya states that "online gender-based violence
                      has been of paramount concern raised all over the world by women, LGBTIQA and non-gender conforming people, but legislation that
                      recognises and acts on these attacks and violence is largely absent in many african countries." This is true because most
                      african constitutions are not progressive as that of South Africa for example, most laws (an institution of power) are still 
                      against women's and LGBTIQA issues, and the people who are in charge of consitutional power in these countries are mostly male.
                      So, in many ways the internet mirrors oppressive norms and ideas that have existed prior to its invention hence, it is for
                      this reason that the inequality of access, participation and representation is replicating existing oppression and suppression
                      of most notably, black women. Therefore, women ,and women in the global south specifically needs to be the vanguard of a new 
                      inclusive internet.
