                      <blockquote>"The world wide web first began life at CERN, a European
                      laboratory for Particle Physics in Geneva, Switzerland".</blockquote>
                      <cite>(Berners-Lee, 1994)</cite>
                      <p>Berners- Lee, the inventor of the concept of the web, came up with a solution
                        to aid the dissemination of research and information
                        amongst his peers and the critical mass. As such he came up
                        with a <strong>distributed</strong> network that allows researchers from
                        different parts of the world to organize and efficiently
                        gather information from multiple sources.</p> 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The web was designed, with the idea of creating a distributed
                      hypertext system that affords users with the ability to work
                      independently. This design is reflected and illustrated by
                      version control systems, namely git and git hub, which
                      provides a platform or server within which a team member can
                      independently work on a team project from remote locations around the world.

                    <p>
                      Typically a client <em></em>(browser) is used to request
                      information off a server <em>(a computer that runs the
                      back-end of the internet)</em> which, is used to store the metadata 
                      of any data that is represented on the internet. The server then responds to the 
                      clients request by retrieving an html document, which it 
                      interprets and describes to the client in order to render 
                      multimedia information.

                      What is multimedia information? Multimedia information is information that can be 
                      rendered as text, visuals and/ or audio. <strong>How is this reflected in my site?
                      </strong>. Well the character of the site uses text, images and videos to describe
                      and illustrate an account of history, and this kind of media is not special only to this site but also 
                      Whatsapp, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram uses multimedia to render information. Therefore, 
                      this is the reason why such websites are able to provide or mediate cultural 
                      experiences because a large part of our lives in today's society adopts teachings
                      and information form these sources and therefore this characterises the internet 
                      as an intersection of different practices, traditions and knowledge that enables 
                      the globalization of culture and beliefs. 
                      This might be good or bad. It might be 
                      good in the sense that it allows people to form or be a part of a cultural identity,
                      but it might be bad because it could create intercultural conflict where beliefs
                      are contested, for example the various big technological companies are banned in 
                      China because as we probably all know by know China is an authoritarian country 
                      so it does not want its people to bare witness to anything that might negate their
                      own culture. Therefore as Uncle Ben always says "With great power comes great
                      responsibility" so it is how we use the internet that is important to always 
                      consider.
