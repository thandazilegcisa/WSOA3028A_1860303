                  In the book, The Library of Babel, Borges writes about a public space, known as the library.
                  This universe of books is typified by identical hexagonal shaped rooms that are inhabited by
                  books that are filled with all of the information that the universe has created as well as 
                  information that is yet to be put into the world...

                  <p>Berners- Lee, the inventor of the concept of the web, came up with a solution
                    to aid the dissemination of research and information
                    amongst his peers and the critical mass. As such he came up
                    with a <strong>distributed</strong> network that allows researchers from
                    different parts of the world to organize and efficiently

                  The word "Semantics" is a branch of semiotics which interprets
                  the representational value of signs and symbols through the study 
                  of meanings.Therefore, we can infer to this 'definition' to establish 
                  that in coding practices, semantics refers to the syntactical 
                  meaning of a piece of code within a given document or script...

                  The most colloquial form of interaction humans partake in communication, and typically we interact
                  through responsive participation through communication. Responsive communication is the enacted output
                  of conversation, which means it is an active response to a question, comment or elaboration. Whereas
                  participation is idle and non-trivial or responsive. As such defining 'interactivity' requires 
                  determining how and why a response makes something interactive? Interaction takes the form of taking
                  control and occurs in the process of user's trying to understand the readability of something to 
                  orient themselves and develop skill in using a product - the internet...

                  In the paper of the above tile, authour Steve Gibson examines and explores interfaces
                  that diverge form the standard mouse-keyboard approaches to interacting with digital systems.
                  He suggests that alternative interfaces can generally be described as control schemes that
                  allow the user to connect to a digital environment <strong>without</strong> the use of
                  conventional mouse-keyboard interfaces...

                  an extension of our daily lives, and our daily lives often includes reading a book, newspaper or even 
                  shopping newspaper. Therefore the architecture of web pages are not outliers in this regard, because they
                  employ the same strategies that other textual mediums exhibit...

                <p>
                  Monitoring the semiotic design of hypermedia is important mainly because understanding how 
                  designers construct meaning through hypermedia is valuable for the designer themselves so 
                  that there is semantic coherence across the platform and the contents that it provides.
                  Semiotics as a theory is a very old but gold theory that defines semiotics as signs, signifier
                  that represent or communicate an idea. The very text that you are reading is a referral to semiotics.
