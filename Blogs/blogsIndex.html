                <h3>A refelection on the works of Borges- The Library of Babel</h3>
                <p>
                  In the book, The Library of Babel, Borges writes about a public space, known as the library.
                  This universe of books is typified by identical hexagonal shaped rooms that are inhabited by
                  books that are filled with all of the information that the universe has created as well as 
                  information that is yet to be put into the world. The library of babel has no limits, which 
                  is indicative of the way the internet structures information. The proliferation of the internet
                  over past three decades has allowed many people across a broad range of demographics and 
                  geographies to partake in the knowledge formation and economy of what is shared on the internet.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The library of babel is exemplary of our ability to search for something on the internet. A user
                  has no limits as to what they can search for because the internet has information that the universe
                  has created, reference or adapted from traditional media, and information yet to be put into the word
                  but put into the world at the point of searching or providing any input to the system. The library of
                  babel signifies a public space that is unconstrained, therefore information might be very hard to get,
                  thus it is interesting to consider Borges book, the Garden of Forking Paths to illustrate how scale can be 
                  mitigated by affectively managing 'time'. It writes that time is an important factor to consider because
                  time is a metaphor for diverging paths. Paths that exist simultaneously continuously intertwining and 
                  diverging all in one structure - the garden. So, this is indicative of how the browser as a structure 
                  can help us save time by creating tabs that can be concieved in the light that Borges suggests. Therefore
                  this introduces the idea of hypertext and hyperlinking of information, which makes it easier to 
                  scale on information and save time while at it.

                <h3>A reflection on Tim Berners Lee's: The World Wide Web.</h3>
                <p>
                  <blockquote>"The world wide web first began life at CERN, a European
                  laboratory for Particle Physics in Geneva, Switzerland".</blockquote>
                  <cite>(Berners-Lee, 1994)</cite>
                  <p>Berners- Lee, the inventor of the web, came up with a solution
                    to aid the dissemination of research and information
                    amongst his peers and the critical mass. As such he came up
                    with a <strong>distributed</strong> network that allows researchers from
                    different parts of the world to organize and efficiently
                    gather information from multiple sources.</p> 
                </p>
                <p>
                  The web was designed, with the idea of creating a distributed
                  hypertext system that affords users with the ability to work
                  independently. This design is reflected and illustrated by
                  version control systems, namely git and git hub, which
                  provides a platform or server within which a team member can
                  independently work on a team project from remote locations around the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Typically a client <em></em>(browser) is used to request
                  information off a server <em>(a computer that runs the
                  back-end of the internet)</em> which, is used to store the metadata 
                  of any data that is represented on the internet. The server then responds to the 
                  clients request by retrieving an html document, which it 
                  interprets and describes to the client in order to render 
                  multimedia information.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What is mutimedia information? Multimedia information is information that can be 
                  rendered as text, visuals and/ or audio. This is the type of media, apps such as 
                  Whatsapp, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram use to render information. Therefore, 
                  this is the reason why such websites are able to provide or mediate cultural 
                  experiences because a large part of our lives in today's society adopts teachings
                  and information form these sources and therefore this characterises the internet 
                  as an intersection of different practices, traditions and knowledge that enables 
                  the globalization of culture and beliefs. This might be good or bad. It might be 
                  good in the sense that it allows people to form or be a part of a cultural identity,
                  but it might be bad because it could create intercultural conflict where beliefs
                  are contested, for example the various big technological companies are banned in 
                  China because as we probably all know by know China is an authoritarian country 
                  so it does not want its people to bare witness to anything that might negate their
                  own culture. Therefore as Uncle Ben always says "With great power comes great
                  responsibility" so it is how we use the internet that is important to always 
                  consider.

                <h3>What is Semantic Markup? Why is it necessary?</h3>
                <p>
                  The word "Semantics" is a branch of semiotics which interprets
                  the representational value of signs and symbols through the study 
                  of meanings.Therefore, we can infer to this 'definition' to establish 
                  that in coding practices, semantics refers to the syntactical 
                  meaning of a piece of code within a given document or script.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To give a document or a web page meaning is to render it usable, responsive,
                  and accessibile to the contextual needs of any user receiving information 
                  from a browser. If the browsers contextual needs are met, the browser will 
                  be able to render all the documents needed to structure, and embed multimedia
                  faster to optimize the performance of the web so that every user is able to 
                  "experience" the web.Another reason would be for the optimization of web 
                  searches, and monitoring of web services and sites.
                </p>
                <h3>What is a browser and how does it work?</h3>
                <p>
                  A browser is a client - side programme that hosts users requests and responds
                  with various multimedia elements (texts, images, audio, and videos). 
                  This occurs whenever a user requests a document by entering a URL, clicking a link 
                  or submitting a form. As such the Semantic mark up of the page becomes paramount
                  to the prospects of minimizing the delay between client - server interaction.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The browser begins by identifying the markup of a given webpage and attempts to
                  find where the embedded multimedia elements are located. For secure transactions to
                  take place within this process a TLS negotiation needs to take place to 
                  negotiate and determine how to encrypt communication between users, and verifies
                  the server to establish a secure connection between the client and the server to
                  prevent the user from becoming exposed to any malicious intent. After a connection is 
                  established parsing takes place, this is a step the browser takes to turn the 
                  data it receives over the network and into the Dom, which is then used to render
                  a web pages layout, paint, style and compositing described within an html and 
                  the DOM tree - a DOM tree describes the content of a document, and reflects the 
                  different semantic, stylistic relationships, and hypermedia a web page has to offer.

                <h3>How does the Medium is the Message impact our understanding of the web</h3>
                <p>
                  In the book: The medium is the message Marshal McLuhan writes that
                  <blockquote>"The medium is the message because it is the medium that shapes and controls
                    the scale and form of human association and action and thus the medium in which a information
                    is communicated through is more important than the message itself"
                  </blockquote>
                  <cite>(McLuhan, 1964)</cite>
                </p>
                <p>To understand what this means we have to first understand what medium and message mean.
                  Medium, refers to the tools or instruments used to provide agency to a user. Message refers
                  to the contextual underpinnings that tools use to cultivate meaning through the use of 
                  semiotics such as text, images, and audio all of which are hypermedia which provide an 
                  extension outside the traditional analogue media constraints.
                </p>
                <p>With this knowledge we are able to understand the world wide web as a mechanic that functions 
                  as an interconnected continuum of inter-textual meanings created by the ability for the medium 
                  to have an adverse effect on the scale and form of human action. Therefore,through the structure
                  and configuration of hypermedia, and hyperlinking. It becomes clear that the the non-linear 
                  reception and reciprocation of threads of information between a network of people sharing and 
                  retrieving information on a distributed network is the message.

                <h3>What interactivity means on the www</h3>
                <p>
                  The most colloquial form of interaction humans partake in communication, and typically we interact
                  through responsive participation through communication. Responsive communication is the enacted output
                  of conversation, which means it is an active response to a question, comment or elaboration. Whereas
                  participation is idle and non-trivial or responsive. As such defining 'interactivity' requires 
                  determining how and why a response makes something interactive? Interaction takes the form of taking
                  control and occurs in the process of user's trying to understand the readability of something to 
                  orient themselves and develop skill in using a product - the internet.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Therefore, <blockquote>"Something is interactive if 
                  it is <strong>responsive</strong>, <strong>does not completely control</strong>, is <strong>
                  not completely controlled, and does not <strong>respond in a random fashion</strong>
                  </strong>"
                  </blockquote>
                  <cite> (Aaron Smuts, 2017)</cite>
                  <h4>Which begs to question, How does interaction work on the world wide web?</h4>

                  <p>Well, interaction on the web is commonly weakly interactive as compared to something like a game.
                    Although, one can always develop a game or strongly interactive art on the web that could also 
                    make the web strongly interactive, meaning that users would not only be be able to affect the 
                    the way in which the reception of information is sequenced, but as well as affecting the process 
                    of how something is structured and/or made.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Therefore, interaction on the web occurs through the use of the following: <br>
                    <ol>
                      <li>User Interface</li>
                      <li>Mouse Events</li>
                      <li>Keyboard Events</li>
                    </ol>
                    <dl>
                      <dt><h5><em>User Interface:</em></h5></dt>
                      <dd>
                        These type of events are non diegetic events that does not affect the structure of 
                        a webpage, instead it affects how the browser presents information by resizing 
                        the browser if needed or scrolling to explore the entirety of the web page.
                      </dd>
                      <dt><h5><em>Mouse Events:</em></h3></dt>
                      <dd>
                        These are events that we all use on a daily basis to an extent that we just passively 
                        execute them when we moves or click a mouse button on a webpage.
                      </dd>
                      <dt><h5><em>Keyboard Events:</em></h5></dt>
                      <dd>This is another event that we use on a daily basis, but i would argue that typing on 
                        a keyaboard is not as passive as mouse events because i - the user am confronted with 
                        more input choices than a mouse. This gives me the opportunity to be more meaningful 
                        in my decisions, such as when i look for the write letter to complete a word or sentence.
                    </dl>
                  </p>
                </p>
                <h3>A reflection on a brief history of Web Robots</h3>
                <p>Web Robots are defined as web spiders that search the internet for different types of information.
                  Thus, they can be used for cyber security purposes or malicious automated attempts to protect,
                  locate information easier and by extension attack websites for information by finding vulnerabilities.
                  Web bots usually perform repetitive tasks, with a higher efficiency rate and scale that would normally 
                  be slowand tedious for humans to perform manually. Therefore, they are often referred to as the worker 
                  bees of the internet.
                </p>
                <p>Ultimately there are advantages and disadvantages to bots: they inspect the accessibility or usability 
                  to help make the internet inclusive and yet they are the cause of malicious intent because different 
                  malicious web bots are used by hackers to exploit a system or in some instances they may be used to 
                  cause traffic, which could result in latencies in client response and therefore prevent people form 
                  visiting a specific Website.
