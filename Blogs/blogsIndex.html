                  In the book, The Library of Babel, Borges writes about a public space, known as the library.
                  This universe of books is typified by identical hexagonal shaped rooms that are inhabited by
                  books that are filled with all of the information that the universe has created as well as 
                  information that is yet to be put into the world...

                  The word "Semantics" is a branch of semiotics which interprets
                  the representational value of signs and symbols through the study 
                  of meanings.Therefore, we can infer to this 'definition' to establish 
                  that in coding practices, semantics refers to the syntactical 
                  meaning of a piece of code within a given document or script...

                  The most colloquial form of interaction humans partake in communication, and typically we interact
                  through responsive participation through communication. Responsive communication is the enacted output
                  of conversation, which means it is an active response to a question, comment or elaboration. Whereas
                  participation is idle and non-trivial or responsive. As such defining 'interactivity' requires 
                  determining how and why a response makes something interactive? Interaction takes the form of taking
                  control and occurs in the process of user's trying to understand the readability of something to 
                  orient themselves and develop skill in using a product - the internet...

                  shopping newspaper. Therefore the architecture of web pages are not outliers in this regard, because they

                  Monitoring the semiotic design of hypermedia is important mainly because understanding how 
                  designers construct meaning through hypermedia is valuable for the designer themselves so 
                  that there is semantic coherence across the platform and the contents that it provides.
                  Semiotics as a theory is a very old but gold theory that defines semiotics as signs, signifier
                  that represent or communicate an idea. The very text that you are reading is a referral to semiotics.

                  Information is innately entrenched within the context within which it is formed and argued upon.
                  Therefore, the study of information geographies examine how context shapes or is mediated by the 
                  infrastructure, technologies and networks within a specific context. Ever since the proliferation
                  of post-mechanical re-production ability of computers the transmission and movement of information
                  has become much more accessibile, and by accessibile I mean non-exclusive. However, there are are 
                  certain barriers to entry that have their own geographic effects on the overall reception of information
                  across the world, this includes considerations regarding how, easily certain geographies have access
                  to participate and represent themselves on the internet using computing devices such as mobile phones
                  and computers.

                  In the article of the above title, authour Christoph Lutz investigates the disparities in the structure of access to and
                  use of ICT as well as how historical socio-economic inequalities shape the expectations and impact of what ICT can 
                  provide for life on earth. According to Lutz (2015) traditionally disadvantaged citizens, which we mostly see in the 
                  global south are similarly disadvantaged on the internet.Therefore according to Lutz (2015) "optimistic claims that 
                  the internet would create widespread social mobility and would lead to less stratified societies have been challenged
                  by digital inequality scholars."

                  In the paper of the above title, authours Hassenzahl et al. (2005) examine what is meant by user experience. I also attempts 
                  to demonstrate the relation or lack thereof of the designer's intentions and a user's actual experience. Since the beginning
                  of the proliferation or web apps, games and the internet interaction on these applications or mediums have called for considering
                  how a user will experience using the medium. Thus, early research on the phenomenological experience of products have largely 
                  focused on the outcome of goals in work settings. This includes leader-boards, badges, point-systems and UI to ensure that a product 
                  is designed <strong>for</strong> an optimal experience.
