                      The word "Semantics" is a branch of semiotics which interprets
                      the representational value of signs and symbols through the study 
                      of meanings.Therefore, we can infer to this 'definition' to establish 
                      that in coding practices, semantics refers to the syntactical 
                      meaning of a piece of code within a given document or script.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      To give a document or a web page meaning is to render it usable, responsive,
                      and accessibile to the contextual needs of any user receiving information 
                      from a browser. If the browsers contextual needs are met, the browser will 
                      be able to render all the documents needed to structure, and embed multimedia
                      faster to optimize the performance of the web so that every user is able to 
                      "experience" the web.Another reason would be for the optimization of web 
                      searches, and monitoring of web services and sites.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What is a browser and how does it work?</h3>
                    <p>
                      A browser is a client - side programme that hosts users requests and responds
                      with various multimedia elements (texts, images, audio, and videos). 
                      This occurs whenever a user requests a document by entering a URL, clicking a link 
                      or submitting a form. As such the Semantic mark up of the page becomes paramount
                      to the prospects of minimizing the delay between client - server interaction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The browser begins by identifying the markup of a given webpage and attempts to
                      find where the embedded multimedia elements are located. For secure transactions to
                      take place within this process a TLS negotiation needs to take place to 
                      negotiate and determine how to encrypt communication between users, and verifies
                      the server to establish a secure connection between the client and the server to
                      prevent the user from becoming exposed to any malicious intent. After a connection is 
                      established parsing takes place, this is a step the browser takes to turn the 
                      data it receives over the network and into the Dom, which is then used to render
                      a web pages layout, paint, style and compositing described within an html and 
                      the DOM tree - a DOM tree describes the content of a document, and reflects the 
                      different semantic, stylistic relationships, and hypermedia a web page has to offer.
