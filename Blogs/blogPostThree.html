                      The word "Semantics" is a branch of semiotics which interprets
                      the representational value of signs and symbols through the study 
                      of meanings.Therefore, we can infer to this 'definition' to establish 
                      that in coding practices, semantics refers to the syntactical 
                      meaning of a piece of code within a given document or script.
                      For example: This is reflected through the site by means of an IDE,
                      which is where i write my code. And because the web is quite old, there 
                      are already web standards that us as developers should consider. Which 
                      is why i have markup such as a 'p tag that i used to write this paragraph 
                      so that the layout of my website has semantic meaning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Therefore, to give a document or a web page meaning is to render it usable, responsive,
                      and accessibile to the contextual needs of any user receiving information 
                      from a browser. If the browsers contextual needs are met, the browser will 
                      be able to render all the documents needed to structure, and embed multimedia
                      faster to optimize the performance of the web so that every user is able to 
                      "experience" the web.Another reason would be for the optimization of web 
                      searches, and monitoring of web services and sites.
