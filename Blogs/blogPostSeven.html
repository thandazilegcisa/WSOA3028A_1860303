                Interpreting the Layout of Web Pages
              </h3>

              <p>
                Ever since the proliferation of the internet interpreting the
                layout of web pages has become something that users innately
                do.And this is largely due to the fact that as stated in
                previous articles, the internet is an extension of our daily
                lives, and our daily lives often includes reading a book,
                newspaper or even shopping newspaper. Therefore the architecture
                of web pages are not outliers in this regard, because they
                employ the same strategies that other textual mediums exhibit.
              </p>
              <p>
                In fact from a historical perspective, news and shopping web
                sites are relative newcomers to well-established fields with
                long-standing practices and conventions. Hence, since the
                proliferation of the internet web pages have adopted
                characteristic document formats and designs based on what has
                proven to work well for print media. Therefore, much like print
                media the use of multiple and modular layouts have been used to
                either replicate a news platform on the internet or simply to
                effectively manage an abundance of information on the page if
                any. For years multi-column layouts have been used in news and
                shopping newspapers, mainly because they make pages easier to
                read and provide flexibility for the way in which layout is
                designed On the other hand modular layouts, commonly used by
                newspapers and magazines - are even more flexible than strict
                column formats. They use a combination of vertical an horizontal
                shapes to arrange the information.

                As such following convention is somewhat useful because like in
                the case of books or newspapers. Generally people read from the
                top-left corner to the bottom-right (except if you are from
                Japan and read from right to left). And by virtue of following
                conventions with regard to core structural functions such as
                navigation and format of content is important because it can
                improve the accessibility of a platform. If a website (as
                mentioned in previous blogs) is accessible it means that
                assistive technologies such as screen readers would be a able to
                assist visually impaired people. However in a study that was
                done by the authour it is shown that web sites that display a
                modular layout are the most problematic for visually impaired
                users because although they might be easier and and prettier to
                read for sighted users, the same cannot be said for visually
                impaired users because its complexity poses a threat to to the
                ability of screen readers to efficiently communicate the
                embedded meanings of the document.
